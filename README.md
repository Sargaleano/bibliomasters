## Brief overview

The evolution of a Master's programme, like many other human institutions, can be viewed as a self-organising system whose underlying structures and dynamics arise primarily from the interaction of its faculty and students. Identifying these hidden properties may not be a trivial task, due to the complex behaviour implicit in such evolution. Nonetheless, bibliometric analyses on the dissertations completed within the programme may serve that purpose. Such analyses can reveal insights about production growth, collaborative networks, and visual mapping of dominant, niche, and emerging research topics, among other facets. 

The paper describes a bibliometric workflow intended to discover the production dynamics, as well as the conceptual, social and intellectual structures developed by the Master's degree, in the interest of facilitating a better assessment of the strengths of the programme and to prioritise strategic planning goals.
